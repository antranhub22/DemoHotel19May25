# üßπ **Professional Repository Cleanup - Complete Guide**

## **üéØ Professional Cleanup Strategy**

### **üìã Pre-Cleanup Assessment**

#### **Step 1: Create Comprehensive Backup**
```bash
# Git backup
git branch backup-before-cleanup
git push origin backup-before-cleanup

# Database backup (if applicable)
pg_dump your_database > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Full repository backup
tar -czf repo_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz ../mi-nhon-hotel/
```

#### **Step 2: Document Current State**
```bash
@Codebase Create a comprehensive audit report of our current repository state:

1. Generate complete file tree with sizes
2. List all dependencies and their usage
3. Identify all entry points and critical paths
4. Document current functionality and features
5. Map out component dependencies
6. List all environment variables and configurations
7. Document all scripts and build processes

This will be our baseline for cleanup validation.
```

## **üîç PHASE 1: DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS**

### **Step 3: Dead Code Detection**
```bash
@Codebase Perform comprehensive dead code analysis:

1. Find unused files across the entire repository
2. Identify unused functions and variables
3. Detect unreachable code paths
4. Find unused imports and exports
5. Identify unused dependencies in package.json
6. Locate orphaned assets (images, fonts, etc.)
7. Find commented-out code blocks
8. Identify debug/development-only code

Categorize findings by risk level (safe to remove vs. needs investigation).
```

### **Step 4: Dependency Analysis**
```bash
@Codebase Analyze all dependencies comprehensively:

1. Check package.json files for unused dependencies
2. Identify duplicate dependencies across packages
3. Find outdated packages with security vulnerabilities
4. Locate dependencies that can be replaced with lighter alternatives
5. Check for dev dependencies in production dependencies
6. Identify peer dependency issues
7. Find packages with overlapping functionality

Create removal/update plan with impact assessment.
```

### **Step 5: Code Quality Assessment**
```bash
@Codebase Assess code quality issues that need cleanup:

1. Find duplicate code blocks across files
2. Identify overly complex functions/components
3. Locate inconsistent coding patterns
4. Find missing error handling
5. Identify performance bottlenecks
6. Check for security vulnerabilities
7. Find accessibility issues
8. Locate inconsistent naming conventions

Prioritize by impact on maintainability and performance.
```

## **üóëÔ∏è PHASE 2: SAFE CLEANUP EXECUTION**

### **Step 6: Remove Dead Files (Low Risk)**
```bash
@Codebase Start with safest cleanup - remove clearly unused files:

1. Delete obviously unused test files and mocks
2. Remove old backup files and temporary files
3. Delete unused documentation files
4. Remove unused asset files (after verification)
5. Delete old configuration files no longer referenced
6. Remove unused migration files (with caution)

For each deletion, verify no hidden references exist.
```

### **Step 7: Clean Up Dependencies**
```bash
@Codebase Clean up package dependencies safely:

1. Remove clearly unused dependencies (verify with bundle analyzer)
2. Update outdated dependencies to latest stable versions
3. Consolidate duplicate dependencies
4. Replace heavy dependencies with lighter alternatives
5. Move dev dependencies to correct section
6. Remove deprecated packages

Test thoroughly after each dependency change.
```

### **Step 8: Remove Commented Code**
```bash
@Codebase Remove commented-out code and clean up comments:

1. Delete all commented-out code blocks
2. Remove TODO comments that are no longer relevant
3. Delete debug console.log statements
4. Remove development-only code paths
5. Clean up redundant comments
6. Standardize remaining comment format

Keep only valuable comments that explain business logic.
```

## **üîß PHASE 3: CODE OPTIMIZATION**

### **Step 9: Consolidate Duplicate Code**
```bash
@Codebase Identify and consolidate duplicate code:

1. Extract common utility functions to shared modules
2. Consolidate similar components into reusable variants
3. Create shared constants for repeated values
4. Extract common patterns into custom hooks
5. Consolidate similar API call patterns
6. Create shared type definitions

Ensure no functionality is lost during consolidation.
```

### **Step 10: Optimize Imports and Exports**
```bash
@Codebase Optimize import/export structure:

1. Remove unused imports across all files
2. Consolidate multiple imports from same module
3. Use named imports instead of default where appropriate
4. Create barrel exports for cleaner imports
5. Sort imports consistently
6. Remove unnecessary type-only imports

Use automated tools where possible for consistency.
```

### **Step 11: Clean Up Assets and Resources**
```bash
@Codebase Optimize assets and static resources:

1. Remove unused images, fonts, and static files
2. Optimize image sizes and formats
3. Compress large assets

## **üéØ PROFESSIONAL CLEANUP BEST PRACTICES**

### **üîÑ Iterative Approach**
```bash
# After each major step:
@Codebase Validate that all functionality still works after this cleanup step. Run tests and check for any regressions before proceeding.

# Before each risky change:
@Codebase Before removing [specific files/code], help me verify these are truly unused and identify any potential impacts.

# If issues arise:
@Codebase The cleanup broke [specific functionality]. Help me identify what was removed incorrectly and restore it while keeping beneficial cleanup changes.
```

---

## **üö® Safety Guidelines**

### **‚ùå Never Do These During Cleanup:**
1. **Remove files without verification** - Always check for dependencies
2. **Delete database migrations** - Unless absolutely certain they're unused
3. **Remove environment variables** - Without checking all environments
4. **Delete test files** - Without ensuring coverage is maintained
5. **Clean multiple areas simultaneously** - Focus on one area at a time
6. **Skip testing** - Always validate after changes

### **‚úÖ Always Do These:**
1. **Make small, incremental changes** - Easier to track and rollback
2. **Test after each major change** - Catch issues early
3. **Document what you remove** - For potential restoration
4. **Use version control** - Commit frequently with clear messages
5. **Get team review** - Have others validate cleanup changes
6. **Monitor performance** - Ensure cleanup improves rather than degrades
