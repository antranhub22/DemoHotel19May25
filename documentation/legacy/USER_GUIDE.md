## 💡 Best Practices

### Setting Up Your Knowledge Base

#### Complete Information
✅ **Do:**
- Include all hotel amenities and services
- Provide accurate hours and contact information
- Add local attractions and recommendations
- Include pricing for services (where appropriate)

❌ **Don't:**
- Leave services undefined or vague
- Forget to update seasonal changes
- Provide outdated contact information

#### Clear Service Descriptions
```
✅ Good Example:
"Our spa offers therapeutic massages, facials, and body treatments. 
Open daily 9 AM - 8 PM. Reservations recommended. 
Call extension 4567 or ask me to book for you."

❌ Poor Example:
"We have a spa."
```

### Voice Assistant Optimization

#### Response Quality
- **Be Specific**: Provide detailed, actionable information
- **Be Helpful**: Offer additional relevant suggestions
- **Be Consistent**: Maintain your chosen personality throughout
- **Be Accurate**: Regularly update information to stay current

#### Handling Complex Requests
```
Guest: "I need a restaurant recommendation for a romantic dinner."

✅ Good Response:
"I'd recommend 'La Terrazza' on the 5th floor - our romantic rooftop 
restaurant with city views. They serve Italian cuisine, open 6-11 PM, 
reservations essential. Or for something nearby, 'Sunset Bistro' 
is a 5-minute walk with excellent reviews. Would you like me to 
make a reservation at either location?"

❌ Poor Response:
"We have restaurants."
```
