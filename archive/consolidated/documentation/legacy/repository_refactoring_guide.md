## **üéØ EXECUTION WORKFLOW**

### **How to Use These Commands:**

1. **Start with thorough analysis** - Don't skip the assessment phases
2. **Execute one phase at a time** - Each phase builds on previous ones
3. **Test frequently** - Validate functionality after major changes
4. **Keep backups** - Use git branches and commits liberally
5. **Document changes** - Track what was changed and why

### **Risk Management:**

```bash
# Before starting any phase:
@Codebase Before implementing this refactoring phase, help me identify potential risks and create a rollback plan.

# If something breaks:
@Codebase The refactoring broke [specific functionality]. Help me identify what went wrong and fix it while preserving the refactoring improvements.

# Emergency rollback:
@Codebase I need to rollback the refactoring changes safely. Show me how to restore functionality while keeping beneficial changes.
```

### **Success Criteria:**

‚úÖ **Zero functionality loss**  
‚úÖ **Improved code organization**  
‚úÖ **Better maintainability**  
‚úÖ **Reduced code duplication**  
‚úÖ **Cleaner dependencies**  
‚úÖ **Better performance**
