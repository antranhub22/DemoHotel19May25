## 🎯 Active Development

**For all new features and development, use:**

✅ **Interface1** - Located at `../Interface1.tsx` ✅ **RefactoredAssistantContext** - Modular
contexts architecture

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

This project now focuses on **Interface1-only development**:

1. **Interface1**: Core development platform
2. **Interface3/4**: Legacy reference code only
3. **Architecture**: Modular contexts for better maintainability

**ALL new features should be built in Interface1** 🚀
