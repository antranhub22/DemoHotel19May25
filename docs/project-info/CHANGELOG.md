## [2.0.0] - 2024-07-14

### üéâ MAJOR RELEASE: Repository Restructure to Monorepo Architecture

This release represents a complete restructuring of the codebase from a traditional folder structure
to a modern monorepo architecture, resulting in significant improvements in maintainability,

   npm install
   npm run typecheck
   ```

2. **Update imports** (if you have local changes):

   ```typescript
   // Old
   import { utils } from '../../../shared/utils';

   // New
   import { utils } from '@shared/utils';
   ```

3. **Update build commands**:

   ```bash
   # Old
   npm run build

   # New
   npm run build:production
   ```

#### **For Deployment**

- Update deployment scripts to use new build commands
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
