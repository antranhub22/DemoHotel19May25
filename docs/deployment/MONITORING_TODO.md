## ✅ TODO: Re-enable Monitoring After Deployment

### **Priority**: High (after successful deployment verification)

### **Steps to Complete**:

- [ ] Verify core application is deployed and running
- [ ] Confirm no deployment issues
- [ ] Run: `npm run enable-monitoring`
- [ ] Rebuild application: `npm run build`
- [ ] Deploy with monitoring enabled
- [ ] Verify monitoring endpoints: `npm run status-monitoring`
- [ ] Test monitoring features
- [ ] Delete this TODO file

### **Quick Commands**:

```bash
# Check current status
npm run check-monitoring

# Enable monitoring
npm run enable-monitoring

# Build and test
npm run build
npm run status-monitoring

# Verify monitoring
curl /api/monitoring/status
curl /api/health/architecture
```

### **Documentation**:

- **Re-enable Guide**: `MONITORING_RE_ENABLE_GUIDE.md`
- **Deployment Fix**: `MONITORING_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`
- **Rollback Script**: `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.sh`

## 🔔 REMINDER SYSTEM

### **Automatic Reminders**:

- ✅ Package.json scripts: `npm run remind-monitoring`
- ✅ Startup reminders: Built into app startup
- ✅ Status checker: `npm run check-monitoring`
- ✅ Auto-enable script: `npm run enable-monitoring`

### **Manual Reminders**:

- 📅 **Calendar**: Set calendar reminder to check monitoring in 1 week
- 📝 **Git**: This file will appear in git status until monitoring is re-enabled
- 💻 **Terminal**: Run `npm run remind-monitoring` anytime

- Real-time system metrics (CPU, memory, load)
- Application metrics (requests, response times, errors)
- Module-specific performance tracking
- Custom business metrics

### **Integration Features**:

- ServiceContainer monitoring
- FeatureFlags change tracking
- ModuleLifecycle health monitoring
- Performance correlation analysis

### **API Endpoints** (20+ endpoints available):

- `/api/monitoring/status` - Overall monitoring status
- `/api/monitoring/logs/*` - Enhanced logging endpoints
- `/api/monitoring/metrics/*` - System metrics endpoints
- `/api/monitoring/performance/*` - Performance tracking
- `/api/monitoring/health-check` - Comprehensive health check

## 🎉 COMPLETION CHECKLIST

When monitoring is successfully re-enabled:

- [ ] ✅ Monitoring auto-initialization active
- [ ] ✅ All endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] ✅ System health monitoring working
- [ ] ✅ Performance metrics collecting
- [ ] ✅ Enhanced logging operational
- [ ] ✅ No deployment issues observed
- [ ] 🗑️ **DELETE THIS FILE**

**⚡ Remember**: Enhanced Logging & Metrics v2.0 is fully implemented and ready - just temporarily
disabled for safe deployment!

**🎯 Goal**: Re-enable monitoring to get full observability and advanced system insights.
