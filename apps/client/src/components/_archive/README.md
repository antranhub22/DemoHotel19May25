# 📚 Archive Directory - Deprecated Code

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT - ARCHIVED COMPONENTS

**This directory contains ARCHIVED code that is no longer in active use.**

### 🗑️ PURPOSE: LAYER 1 CLEANUP

This archive was created during **Layer 1: Core Structure** cleanup to:

- **Remove deprecated code** from active development
- **Preserve reference patterns** for future developers
- **Maintain git history** while cleaning up structure
- **Document migration paths** for legacy components

---

## 📂 CONTENTS

### `_reference/` - Legacy Interface Components

- **Interface3.tsx** - ❌ DISABLED order summary interface
- **Interface4.tsx** - ❌ DISABLED confirmation interface
- **Purpose**: Reference for UI patterns, DO NOT use in development
- **Use Instead**: Interface1 for all active development

### `context-reference/` - Legacy Context System

- **AssistantContext.tsx** - ❌ DISABLED monolithic context
- **Purpose**: Reference for state management patterns
- **Use Instead**: RefactoredAssistantContext for all development

### `routes.ts.old` - Legacy Backend Routes

- **routes.ts.old** - ❌ DEPRECATED monolithic routes file
- **Purpose**: Reference for API patterns before modular split
- **Use Instead**: Modular routes in `apps/server/routes/` directory

---

## 🎯 ACTIVE ALTERNATIVES

**For all new development, use these active components:**

### ✅ **Active Voice Interface**

- **Location**: `apps/client/src/components/business/Interface1.tsx`
- **Context**: `apps/client/src/context/AssistantContext.tsx` (refactored)
- **Purpose**: Modern, modular voice assistant interface

### ✅ **Active Component Structure**

```
components/
├── ui/           # Pure UI components
├── business/     # Business logic components
├── layout/       # Layout and structural components
├── features/     # Feature-based modules
└── _archive/     # 👈 You are here - deprecated code
```

### ✅ **Active Backend Routes**

- **Location**: `apps/server/routes/` (modular structure)
- **Purpose**: Clean, organized API endpoints by domain

---

## 🔄 MIGRATION NOTES

### From Interface3/4 → Interface1

- Interface1 now handles all voice assistant functionality
- Order summary and confirmation integrated into Interface1
- Better responsive design and user experience

### From Legacy AssistantContext → Refactored Context

- Modular context architecture (specialized contexts)
- Better state management and performance
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### From Monolithic Routes → Modular Routes

- Split large routes.ts into domain-specific files
- Better maintainability and testing
- Clear API organization

---

## ⚠️ USAGE WARNINGS

### 🚫 DO NOT USE

- **Any code in this directory** for active development
- **Imports from \_archive/** in new components
- **Patterns from archived files** without modernization

### ✅ SAFE TO USE

- **Code as reference** for understanding legacy patterns
- **Documentation** for migration planning
- **Git history** for understanding evolution
