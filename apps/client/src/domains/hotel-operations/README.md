} from "@/domains/hotel-operations";

const HotelDashboard = () => {
  const { rooms, roomCounts, loadRooms, changeRoomStatus } =
    useHotelOperations();

  const { tasks, createNewTask, assignTaskToStaff } = useHousekeeping();

  const { requests, createNewRequest, assignRequestToStaff } = useMaintenance();

  // Component logic
};
```

import { hotelOperationsService } from "@/domains/hotel-operations";

// Room operations
await hotelOperationsService.updateRoomStatus(roomId, "occupied");
await hotelOperationsService.createRoom(roomData);
