DEPLOY TRIGGER: Auth System Fix - Include auth-system in tsconfig.json

Date: July 20, 2024, 12:20 PM
Fix: Added "auth-system/**/*" to tsconfig.json include array
Issue: ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND - auth-system/middleware in production
Solution: TypeScript compiler now includes auth-system folder in build

This should resolve the module not found error in Render deployment.

Previous trigger: 2024-07-20 11:30 AM - Force rebuild attempt
Current trigger: 2024-07-20 12:20 PM - Auth system path fix

Status: Ready for redeploy
