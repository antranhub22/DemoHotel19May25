DEPLOY TRIGGER: Permissions Re-export Fix - Backward Compatibility

Date: July 20, 2024, 12:30 PM
Fix: Created packages/shared/constants/permissions.ts re-export
Issue: TS2307 - Cannot find module '@shared/constants/permissions'
Solution: Re-export from auth-system/types/permissions for backward compatibility

This should resolve:
- TS2307: Cannot find module '@shared/constants/permissions'
- Multiple component import errors
- Auth system module resolution issues

Previous trigger: 2024-07-20 12:20 PM - Auth system tsconfig fix
Current trigger: 2024-07-20 12:30 PM - Permissions backward compatibility

Status: Ready for redeploy to test permissions fix
