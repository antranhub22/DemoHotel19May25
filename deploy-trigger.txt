DEPLOY TRIGGER: Final Auth System Fix - Force Complete Rebuild

Date: July 20, 2024, 12:45 PM
CRITICAL FIX: Updated ALL remaining auth-system imports

Files Fixed:
1. ✅ apps/server/routes/dashboard.ts - Updated to @auth/middleware
2. ✅ apps/server/routes/request.ts - Updated to @auth/middleware  
3. ✅ apps/server/routes/analytics.ts - Updated to @auth/middleware
4. ✅ apps/server/routes.ts - Already using @auth/* aliases
5. ✅ packages/auth-system/ - All files verified to exist

Status: ALL auth-system imports now use @auth/* aliases
