DEPLOY TRIGGER: Auth System Moved to Packages - Complete Path Migration

Date: July 20, 2024, 12:40 PM
Major Fix: Moved auth-system/ to packages/auth-system/

Changes Applied:
1. ✅ mv auth-system packages/auth-system 
2. ✅ Updated tsconfig.json include & path aliases
3. ✅ Updated vite.config.ts aliases  
4. ✅ Updated apps/server/routes.ts imports to use @auth/*
5. ✅ Updated all re-export files to new paths
6. ✅ All auth-system files now in packages/ structure

Issue: Build system not recognizing auth-system at root level
Solution: Moved to packages/ where it's treated as proper package

This should resolve ALL TypeScript module resolution errors:
- auth-system modules now in packages/ ✅
- Path aliases updated ✅
- Imports use @auth/* aliases ✅
- Backward compatibility maintained ✅
