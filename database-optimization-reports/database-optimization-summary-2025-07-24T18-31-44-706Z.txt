ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (7)
- 5 slow queries detected: Implement query performance monitoring and optimization
- Slow query: 2207ms execution time: Avoid SELECT * - specify only needed columns
- Slow query: 2425ms execution time: Avoid SELECT * - specify only needed columns; Consider adding LIMIT clause to ORDER BY queries
- Slow query: 2721ms execution time: 
- Slow query: 2381ms execution time: 
- Missing index on requests(hotel_id, status): CREATE INDEX idx_requests_hotel_id_status ON requests(hotel_id, status)
- Missing index on users(email): CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email)

ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (11)
- Index users_idx_1 has low efficiency (46%): Consider dropping unused index or updating statistics
